Now, let's use the change of variables technique to get the distribution of $\\log(\\psi)p_\\psi$.  This is going to require taking derivatives of some messy expressions.  It is possible, but requires a patient hand or a computer algebra system, neither of which are essential to this prologue.Instead, I'll use `jax` to do some of the differentiation.  I'll explain the steps below, and then demonstrate how this can be done in python with `jax`.\n\n## The Math\n\n## The Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
